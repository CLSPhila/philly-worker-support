        Another option is to quit and file for Unemployment Compensation (UC)
        benefits. To qualify for benefits, you have to try to work things out
        with your employer first. You should discuss your concerns with your
        employer, preferably in writing. Make sure you keep a copy (and not just
        in your work email, which you could lose access to if you get fired).

        unsafe conditions at work may be joining together with people you work
        with to talk to management, contacting an organizing group, or going to
        the press with your concerns. You do not need to be an employee to make
