# Informing Philly's workers of their rights during the pandemic

This site **was** a resource for Philly workers to help them understand the rules around eligibility for various programs, including Unemployment Compensation, paid sick leave, and more.

This site did its job for a while, and then we moved on. The site no longer runs, and this code is not maintained.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on Netlify. Visit it at covidworkerbenefits.clsphila.org.

The `production` branch of this repo is built to Netlify. The `main` branch is where you should make any changes to the code. Test there, and then use a PR to the `production` branch when you are ready to publish your changes.
